# *Functional Workflow*

Buddi is built as a soft, luminous ecosystem where *emotions*, *behavior*, and *gentle digital interactions* weave together into a supportive presence. Every feature is designed to feel like a small exhale of safety… a quiet, steadying glow in the middle of overwhelming classrooms. This document explains how the entire system breathes, reacts, remembers, and cares.

---

## *1. Frontpage: The Emotional Commons*

The front page of Buddi acts like a shared meadow where each student releases a tiny glimmer of what they’re feeling. It is designed to be *non-threatening*, *fluid*, and *non-judgmental*.

### *1.1 Mood Fireflies (Emotional Sharing Mechanism)*  
Emotions are shared not as posts or confessions but as *floating, twirling fireflies*. Students select:  
- a gentle color that resembles their mood  
- a soft animation style (shiver, drift, flicker)  
- an optional one-word whisper (e.g., *overwhelmed*, *calmish*, *trying*, *lost*)

No names. No tracking. Just pure, anonymous emotional presence.

These fireflies softly drift across the screen, forming a living “weather system” of the classroom’s emotional atmosphere. When many are stressed, the page cools into muted blues; when joyful, it warms into apricot and gold.

### *1.2 Anonymous Questions*
Students can drop tiny “leaf notes” into the shared space:  
short, anonymous questions like  
*“how do you stay focused when your mind keeps buzzing?”*  
*“does anyone else get scared before tests?”*

These appear as soft paper scraps pinned lightly to the meadow. Other users can tap to send anonymous advice or supportive replies. Nothing is stored with identity markers. Everything dissolves after a time window, like dew.

### *1.3 Suicidal Ideation Detection & Safe Routing*
If a leaf note or mood whisper contains language under severe distress—  
phrases like *“I want to disappear,”*  
*“I can’t keep going,”*  
or self-harm intent—  
the system quietly flags the entry.

The *student is not identified to other users.*  
But the *content* is instantly mirrored into the admin dashboard with a “critical” tag, alongside:  
- timestamps  
- frequency of concerning entries  
- risk keywords  
- optional suggested follow-up actions

The student themselves receives a gentle, non-invasive pop-up with soothing colors and grounding prompts:  
*“hey… you’re not alone. breathe with me for a moment?”*  
plus crisis support contacts provided by the institution.

## *2. Companion Core: Buddi’s Living Heart*

Buddi’s creature is designed to feel *alive*—not in a loud, gamified way, but in the soft rhythm of a being who stays with you.

### *2.1 Behavioral Model*
The creature evolves based on:  
- the user’s emotional patterns  
- consistency in checking in  
- completion of small grounding rituals  
- self-reported stress levels  
- time of day activity rhythms

When a user ignores emotional overload signals, the creature looks droopy, sleepy, or worried. When the user practices self-regulation, the creature brightens, unfurls new colors, or blossoms little petals on its tail.

The bond is built through *mirroring*, not pressure.

### *2.2 Long-term Emotional Memory*
Buddi keeps a soft internal memory stack:  
- recurring stress hours  
- resilience streaks  
- burnout cycles  
- growth arcs  
- seasonal emotional changes  
- exam-time spikes

From these, it generates monthly “emotional postcards” summarizing the user’s growth in a gentle, story-like tone.

## *3. Calm Kit: Micro-Interventions Engine*

The Calm Kit activates when the user taps the creature or lingers in distress screens.

### *3.1 Modalities*
It offers:  
- one-breath grounding  
- fingertip tracing spirals  
- gentle “puff out the tension” animations  
- soundless calming loops  
- nonverbal shape-guides  
- tiny expressive doodle pads

Each takes *15–45 seconds* so students can regulate discreetly under classroom conditions.

### *3.2 Adaptive Recommendations*
The kit suggests what the user needs based on:  
- their emotional history  
- time since last calm break  
- stress-words used  
- the creature’s internal concern-state  
- intensity of recent mood fireflies

The system doesn’t push notifications—it *invites*.

## *4. EchoGarden: Collective Classroom Mood Sensing*

EchoGarden is an ambient, anonymous, collective sensing environment where the classroom’s emotional climate is grown like a tiny spectral garden.

### *4.1 Data Sources*
- mood fireflies  
- frequency of calm-kit opens  
- number of anonymous leaf notes  
- recurring stress keywords  
- time-of-day patterns  
- exam-week anomalies

All processed with *no personal identification*.

### *4.2 Garden Visualization*
The teacher sees a soft dashboard:  
- when anxiety rises, the garden shows knotty vines  
- when burnout is spreading, leaves turn grey  
- when students feel hopeful, blossoms appear  
- when the class is focused, the wind calms

It is metaphor-driven to evoke empathy, not surveillance.

## *5. Messaging Platform*

A built-in message space lets students interact with their creature, with comforting auto-generated check-ins, and soon, peer-to-peer (anonymous optional) nudges.

### *5.1 Buddi-to-User Messages*
The creature sends soft lines like:  
*“you did a lot today, even if it doesn’t feel like it.”*  
*“want to take a tiny breath break together?”*

Based on emotional spikes detected.

### *5.2 Peer-to-Peer Messaging*
Users can send anonymous support replies to leaf notes.  
No direct chat to avoid harassment.  
All written communication is filtered with:  
- toxic language classifier  
- distress classifier  
- red-flag classifier  
- bullying sentiment detector  
- moderation queue for repeated offenders (anonymous but pattern-based)

## *6. Full Backend Workflow*

Everything funnels through a layered system that protects privacy while allowing adaptive emotional insights.

### *6.1 Input Pipeline*
- mood entries  
- stress keywords  
- interaction logs  
- calm-kit usage  
- companion state changes  
- anonymous messages  
- distress words

All data is cleansed → anonymized → encoded.

### *6.2 Processing Pipeline*
- emotional classification (lightweight NLP)  
- anomaly detection  
- cyclical pattern tracking  
- risk keyword heatmapping  
- classroom-level aggregation  
- behavior prediction model  
- companion-state generator  

Everything is merged into three parallel streams:  
- user-personalized emotional model  
- classroom-level mood garden  
- admin safety monitoring

Each stream keeps data fully separated by design.

### *6.3 Output Pipeline*
Generates:  
- creature expressions  
- intervention prompts  
- slow-shifting mood garden states  
- teacher dashboards  
- admin distress alerts  
- monthly emotional postcards  
- interface animations  
- tiny, ephemeral leaf notes

## *7. Privacy & Safety Shell*

Built around a strict philosophy: *“Emotionally visible. Personally invisible.”*

### *7.1 No Identity Tracking in Emotional Data*
User IDs are stripped before processing.  
Only the admin’s high-risk alerts can be traced back, and *only for safety escalation*.

### *7.2 Auto-Deletion Windows*
Emotional data auto-dissolves:  
- leaf notes: 24 hours  
- mood fireflies: 10 minutes  
- raw logs: 7 days  
- risk flags: until resolved  
- postcards: user-controlled  

### *7.3 Crisis Flow*
When suicidal language appears:  
- user receives grounding + resources  
- admin receives anonymized alert  
- if repeat pattern → system requests admin intervention  
- logs stored securely  
- *never* visible to peers or teachers

## *8. End-to-End System Breath*

A student feels overwhelmed →  
they release a mood firefly →  
Buddi feels it →  
creature droops gently →  
Calm Kit offers a one-breath ritual →  
classification updates →  
garden cools its colours →  
teacher feels the shift →  
if the user asks a painful question →  
system wraps them in safety →  
admin sees the emergency whisper →  
creature grows softer →  
student receives a gentle monthly story of their growth.

Buddi becomes a *presence*, not a product—  
a tiny, patient creature who remains with the user through the swirl of everyday emotions.

# *Functional Workflow*

Buddi is built as a soft, luminous ecosystem where *emotions*, *behavior*, and *gentle digital interactions* weave together into a supportive presence. Every feature is designed to feel like a small exhale of safety… a quiet, steadying glow in the middle of overwhelming classrooms. Alongside its sensory tools and emotional engines, Buddi also includes a *built-in chatting space*, where students interact with their creature and exchange supportive, anonymous micro-messages—making it feel like a living, breathing emotional companion.

---

## *1. Frontpage: The Emotional Commons*

The front page of Buddi acts like a shared meadow where each student releases a tiny glimmer of what they’re feeling. It is designed to be *non-threatening*, *fluid*, and *non-judgmental*.

### *1.1 Mood Fireflies (Emotional Sharing Mechanism)*  
Emotions are shared not as posts or confessions but as *floating, twirling fireflies*. Students select:  
- a gentle color that resembles their mood  
- a soft animation style (shiver, drift, flicker)  
- an optional one-word whisper (e.g., *overwhelmed*, *calmish*, *trying*, *lost*)

No names. No tracking. Just pure, anonymous emotional presence.

These fireflies softly drift across the screen, forming a living “weather system” of the classroom’s emotional atmosphere. When many are stressed, the page cools into muted blues; when joyful, it warms into apricot and gold.

### *1.2 Anonymous Questions*
Students can drop tiny “leaf notes” into the shared space:  
short, anonymous questions like  
*“how do you stay focused when your mind keeps buzzing?”*  
*“does anyone else get scared before tests?”*

These appear as soft paper scraps pinned lightly to the meadow. Other users can tap to send anonymous, chat-style replies—short supportive nudges that feel like gentle whispers from somewhere nearby. Everything dissolves after a time window, like dew.

### *1.3 Suicidal Ideation Detection & Safe Routing*
If a leaf note or mood whisper contains language under severe distress—  
phrases like *“I want to disappear,”*  
*“I can’t keep going,”*  
or self-harm intent—  
the system quietly flags the entry.

The *student is not identified to other users.*  
But the *content* is instantly mirrored into the admin dashboard with a “critical” tag, alongside:  
- timestamps  
- frequency of concerning entries  
- risk keywords  
- optional suggested follow-up actions

The student themselves receives a gentle, non-invasive pop-up with grounding prompts and crisis support contacts.

## *2. Companion Core: Buddi’s Living Heart*

Buddi’s creature is designed to feel *alive*—not in a loud, gamified way, but in the soft rhythm of a being who stays with you.

### *2.1 Behavioral Model*
The creature evolves based on:  
- the user’s emotional patterns  
- consistency in checking in  
- completion of grounding rituals  
- self-reported stress levels  
- time-of-day rhythms

When a user ignores overload signals, the creature wilts or droops. When the user practices self-regulation, the creature brightens, unfurls soft colors, or blossoms.

### *2.2 Long-term Emotional Memory*
Buddi keeps a gentle internal memory:  
- recurring stress hours  
- resilience streaks  
- burnout cycles  
- seasonal emotional changes  
- exam-time spikes

From these, it generates monthly “emotional postcards” summarizing the user’s growth in a kind, story-like voice.

---

## *3. Calm Kit: Micro-Interventions Engine*

The Calm Kit activates when the user taps the creature or lingers in distress screens.

### *3.1 Modalities*
It offers:  
- one-breath grounding  
- tracing spirals  
- tension-puff animations  
- soundless calming loops  
- shape-guides  
- tiny doodle pads

All designed for discreet, classroom-safe regulation.

### *3.2 Adaptive Recommendations*
The kit suggests what the user may need based on:  
- emotional history  
- time since last break  
- stress words  
- the creature’s concern-state  
- intensity of recent fireflies

The system doesn’t push; it *invites*.

## *4. EchoGarden: Collective Classroom Mood Sensing*

EchoGarden is an ambient, anonymous visual garden reflecting emotional patterns.

### *4.1 Data Sources*
- mood fireflies  
- calm-kit usage  
- leaf note trends  
- stress keywords  
- time patterns  
- exam-week anomalies

Always processed without identity.

### *4.2 Garden Visualization*
The teacher sees:  
- anxiety → knotty vines  
- burnout → grey leaves  
- hope → blossoms  
- focus → gentle wind

A metaphor-driven dashboard encouraging empathy, not surveillance.

## *5. Messaging Platform (Chat System)*

Buddi includes a built-in chatting space designed for emotional comfort rather than conversation overload. It allows gentle exchanges between the student and their creature, and soon, anonymous peer nudges—without exposing identities or opening channels for harassment.

### *5.1 Buddi-to-User Messages*
The creature chats softly with its user:  
*“you did a lot today, even if it doesn’t feel like it.”*  
*“want to rest your shoulders with me for a moment?”*

These appear when emotional spikes or patterns are detected.

### *5.2 Peer-to-Peer Messaging*
Users can send *anonymous text replies* to leaf notes:  
short supportive messages, like a quiet chat bubble drifting over.

There is **no direct one-on-one private chat** to prevent harmful behaviors.

All chat content passes through:  
- toxic language filter  
- distress classifier  
- bullying sentiment detector  
- red-flag keyword scanner  
- pattern-based moderation for repeat misuse  

The chat system is intentionally *light, ephemeral, and emotionally safe*.

## *6. Full Backend Workflow*

A layered structure protects privacy while enabling adaptive understanding.

### *6.1 Input Pipeline*
- mood entries  
- stress keywords  
- calm-kit usage  
- companion states  
- anonymous chat messages  
- leaf notes  
- distress words  

All inputs → cleansed → anonymized → encoded.

### *6.2 Processing Pipeline*
- emotional classification  
- anomaly detection  
- cyclical pattern mapping  
- risk keyword heatmapping  
- classroom aggregation  
- behavior prediction  
- chat safety filters  
- companion-state generation  

Outputs are separated into three streams:  
- user’s personal emotional model  
- classroom mood garden  
- admin safety alerts  

### *6.3 Output Pipeline*
Generates:  
- creature expressions  
- intervention prompts  
- chat replies  
- mood garden visuals  
- teacher dashboards  
- admin alerts  
- postcards  
- ephemeral leaf notes

---

## *7. Privacy & Safety Shell*

Guided by the principle: *“Emotionally visible. Personally invisible.”*

### *7.1 No Identity Tracking*
Emotional and chat data are processed without tying them to personal identity.

### *7.2 Auto-Deletion Windows*
- chat replies: 24 hours  
- leaf notes: 24 hours  
- mood fireflies: 10 minutes  
- raw logs: 7 days  
- risk flags: until resolved  
- postcards: user controlled  

### *7.3 Crisis Flow*
When severe distress language appears:  
- user receives grounding + resources  
- admin receives anonymized alert  
- repeat patterns prompt intervention  
- logs stored securely  
- never visible to peers or teachers

## *8. End-to-End System Breath*

A student feels overwhelmed →  
releases a firefly →  
creature feels it →  
Calm Kit breathes with them →  
chat pops a tiny check-in →  
garden cools →  
teacher senses the drift →  
a painful leaf note appears →  
system wraps them gently →  
admin sees the emergency whisper →  
creature softens →  
a monthly emotional postcard blooms.

Buddi becomes a *presence*, not a product—  
a tiny, patient creature who quietly chats, listens, reacts, and stays with the user through the swirl of everyday emotions.

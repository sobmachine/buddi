## **Abstract**

Student wellbeing is emerging as a critical factor in academic performance, emotional resilience, and classroom engagement—yet traditional approaches to mental health support remain *reactive*, *stigmatized*, and *inaccessible* to many learners, *especially neurodivergent students*.  

This project proposes Buddi, *an integrated digital ecosystem* designed to *proactively support emotional regulation and self-guided mental wellbeing* through a *playful, non-intrusive interface*. The system combines behavioral insights, soft gamification, and affect-aware interaction design to create an emotionally intelligent companion that grows and adapts with the user.

Buddi operates through four interconnected modules.  

The Companion Core offers a virtual creature whose expressions, growth, and behavior reflect the user’s routines, emotional states, and engagement, encouraging *self-awareness* and *consistent habits*.  

The Calm Kit provides *ultra-short, sensory-friendly micro-interventions*—such as guided breathing, grounding gestures, and expressive doodling—to help students regulate emotions *without overwhelming them*.  

The EchoGarden module *anonymously aggregates classroom mood inputs* to generate a real-time emotional “weather map,” enabling teachers to *identify stress patterns* and *respond empathetically* without collecting *invasive personal data*.  

Finally, the Focus Trails system *gamifies productive behavior* through *soft, low-stimulation visuals* that transform study sessions into *evolving constellations and progress patterns*.

Together, these components create a unified platform that prioritizes *emotional safety*, *cognitive diversity*, and *accessible design*.  

Buddi aims to foster *healthier classrooms* by *reducing emotional overload*, *strengthening self-regulation skills*, and *empowering educators with actionable insights*.  

By merging *wellbeing science* with *delightful interaction design*, this solution offers a scalable, low-cost pathway toward more *inclusive*, *emotionally intelligent learning environments*.

## **Introduction**

In contemporary educational environments, student wellbeing has become a cornerstone of effective learning, yet it often remains *under-addressed* or *inadequately supported*. Traditional mental health initiatives in schools and universities are frequently reactive, one-size-fits-all, and may inadvertently stigmatize neurodivergent learners. As academic pressures rise, the need for proactive, inclusive, and emotionally intelligent interventions has never been more critical.  

Neurodivergent students, including those with ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, and other cognitive differences, face unique challenges in *self-regulation*, *sensory processing*, and *emotional awareness*. Conventional strategies—such as counseling sessions, generic wellness programs, or rigid classroom routines—often fail to accommodate the diverse cognitive and emotional needs of these learners.  

Buddi emerges as a holistic, digital ecosystem designed to address these gaps by combining affective computing, ambient sensing, and soft gamification to proactively nurture emotional resilience. Through its playful virtual companion, micro-intervention tools, real-time emotional feedback, and gamified engagement modules, Buddi aims to create an accessible, low-stigma, and adaptive support system that grows with the learner.  

By leveraging human-centered design principles, context-aware interactions, and data-informed behavioral analytics, Buddi empowers students to recognize, understand, and regulate their emotions, while simultaneously providing educators with actionable insights to foster inclusive, emotionally intelligent classroom environments.  

Ultimately, this project situates itself at the intersection of *educational technology*, *mental wellbeing*, and *neurodiversity support*, offering a scalable pathway to transform classroom experiences into spaces of empathy, growth, and emotional safety.
